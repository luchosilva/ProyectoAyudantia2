[Intro: Timbaland]
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head, do the Crip with me
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head, do the Stank with me
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head, do the Wop with me
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head Game

[Verse 1]
First things first (Aftermath) The Chronic is back
This is indo, produced by Timbo
Game over; nah the N.W.A. chain choker
Is burnin rubber inside the Range Rover
Chain smokin,
This ain't another one of those, this the rebirth of Dre
The rebirth of L.A., the rebirth of hip-hop
Another memorial for Makaveli and Big Pop'
Hold up, Timb stop - I said
This another memorial for Makaveli and Big Pop'
G-G-G-G-G - young homey got shit locked
Public Enemy #1, Flavor Flav with a wristwatch
All black G-Units, all black Impala
I'm a schitzo, three-wheelin the six-fo'
50 Cent know
I'm Compton's most wanted when I'm ridin with Timbo

[Chorus]
Girl if you got a big back let me bend that
Show me where your friends at, we can flip that
Let me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)
Let me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)
I'll show you where the Bloods at, where the Crips at
Show you where they flip crack, where they pitch at
Let me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)
Let me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)
